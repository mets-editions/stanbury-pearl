        <p>The Middle English Texts Series offers a diverse and representative array of literary
          texts that medieval readers in the present-day British Isles would have encountered
          between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. It is committed to making available both
          affordable print and open access editions to scholars, teachers, and students of the
          Western Middle Ages. In its digital publications, the series prioritizes a user-friendly
          interface and viewing options, multiple downloadable formats, enhanced searchability and
          filtering, and accessibility to the widest possible range of users.</p>
      </projectDesc>
      <editorialDecl>
        <p>METS takes as its mission the creation of affordable editions that would pass scrutiny
          from the most demanding expert, yet would prove comprehensible, and even enticing, to
          someone who had never read Middle English before. This agenda dictates that METS
          publications offer not a critical edition reflecting all surviving manuscripts, and
          certainly not a diplomatic edition, but a best-text edition, informed by the notes and
          apparatus of earlier editions (where these exist), and by substantive variants from other
          manuscript witnesses. Transcriptions of Middle English texts are lightly modernized to
          ensure a smooth reading experience, while non-English texts preserve both the original
          language and a modern English translation in facing-page format. Each edition offers
          expert assistance with language and lexicon, providing glosses alongside the text(s),
          textual and explanatory notes, elucidation of unfamiliar contexts and traditions, and
          thematic and interpretive possibilities. All editions feature general introductions that
          set the edited text within its own time, place, and traditions, and link it to ancestor,
          congener, and successor materials. All publications contain comprehensive, current
          bibliographies of pertinent scholarship and criticism. House style is adapted from the <hi
            rend="italic">Chicago Manual of Style</hi>.</p>
        <correction>
          <p>This text may include corrections made after the original edition went to press in
            order to correct errors and improve glosses. For a full list of editorial and

        <p style="bodyfirst">In preparing this edition, my deepest debt is to the many former
          editors of <hi rend="italic">Pearl</hi>, and especially to Israel Gollancz and E. V.
          Gordon, whose lexical and etymological wisdom has provided a grounding for all subsequent
          readings of the poem. Anyone newly editing <hi rend="italic">Pearl</hi> sits gratefully
          and nervously on the shoulders of giants.</p>
        <p style="body">For more immediate debts, I would like to acknowledge the generous support
          of institutions that have made important resources available to me. I thank in particular
          the British Library for graciously giving me permission to examine MS Cotton Nero A.x.,
          art. 3, and to use it as my copy text. I owe a particular debt of gratitude to Clare Hall
          for a Visiting Fellowship in the spring of 2000 and also to the Cambridge University
          Library, where much of the work on this edition was conducted. Thanks are due as well to
          the Committee on Research and Publication at the College of the Holy Cross for travel
          support, and to the National Endowment for the Humanities for its continuing support of
          the series.</p>
        <p style="body">Thanks are due as well to students and colleagues who helped me out with
          this project in numerous ways — to Lisa Melodia and Allison Lurker, who read the text and
          provided frank advice on glossing; and to colleagues who read parts of the manuscript or
          offered astute advice: Ross Arthur, John Bowers, Charley Blyth, Jill Mann, Linne Mooney,
          Lynn Staley, Peter Travis, Kathryn Walls, and especially Russell Peck and the editorial
          staff of the Middle English Texts Series, particularly Dana Symons, Mara Amster, and Alan
          Lupack.</p>
